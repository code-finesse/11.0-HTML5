## **Accessibility is...**

The measure of usability by persons with one or more disabilities.

The concept of accessible design ensures both:

- “direct access” — unassisted
- “indirect access” — compatibility with a person's assistive technology

## **Categorizing Accessibility**

There are four major categories of accessibility:

- Visual (myopia, color blindness, glaucoma, albinism)
- Auditory (acoustic trauma, auditory processing disorder, otosclerosis)
- Motor (cerebral palsy, parkinson’s, muscular dystrophy)
- Cognitive (down’s syndrome, autism, global developmental delay, dyslexia)
